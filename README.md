# Coronavirus Twitter analysis


In this project, I analyzed every Tweet posted from September through the beginning of April looking for the spread of hashtags regarding Coronavirus.
To do so, I wrote loops that looked only for tweets that had 2 specific attributes. The first is that they had a location asscociated with them, and
the second is that they contained one of 17 hashtags that I was looking for including #coronavirus, #covid, #covid19, etc. I sorted this set of tweet
two ways, once by language, and once by the country it was posted in. The goal of doing this is again so we could document how the information travel
and popularity of Covid19 spread across the globe. As show in the files in the ``` viz``` folder, we can see that in terms of quantity, the US has 
in general the most tweet's per Hashtag.


This was a very interesting project and provided a great introduction into using python and shell coding to interpret big data.
